# Computing Infrastructure

All DESC members are invited to open GitHub issues on this repo to propose 
computing infrastructure tasks to DESC Computing.  

The DESC Computing Coordinator Team and Computing Working Groups will utilize 
these requests and subsequent discussion to help guide prioritization of work.

Work triggered by these requests can be tracked in the GitHub issues to allow 
others to easily follow task updates and contribute to the work if desired.
